# Pomodoro-Timer
<p>When I was an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley, I often utilized the pomodoro technique to better manage my time and focus. By breaking down my work into smaller, manageable chunks, I was able to remain motivated and efficient in my studying. Additionally, the breaks allowed me to recharge and resume my work with more energy and sometimes new perspectives.</p>

<h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
<p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking down work into intervals known as "pomodoros", traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Once you have completed 4 rounds, you take a longer break to recharge.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Set your focus session timer for 25 minutes.</li>
  <li>At the end of the focus session, set a new timer and take a 5 minute break.</li>
  <li>Repeat these steps for a total of 4 rounds, but after the 4th focus session timer ends, take a 30 minute break.</li>
  <li>Congratulations! You've completed a full pomodoro session. Feel free to adjust the focus session or break lengths and repeat.</li>
</ol>
